# Pig E. Bank – Customer Retention

Pig E. Bank is a hypothetical financial institution with customer retention concerns. One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so you’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project. The sales team would like to identify the leading indicators that a customer would leave the bank.

To develop a plan to improve customer retention, the sales team wants to identify the leading indicators that a customer will leave the bank. The sales team provided a table of client attributes that could indicate whether customers will leave—for example, age, estimated salary, etc. This information will be used to identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss so they can be modeled in a decision tree.

The sales team has requested that I  assess the quality of the data, by checking for missing values, errors, and inconsistencies; and that I clean the data, fix any inconsistencies in the table and/or any errors to the extent possible. The sales team has further requested that I document my processes for assessing the data quality and cleaning the data and note down any missing values or errors.

## Project Specifications

- Separate the clients into 2 groups: one for those who have left the bank and a second for those who have stayed. This should be done using the ExitedFromBank field; a value of 1 will be present for each customer who has left the bank.

 - Use pivot tables and other Excel functions to identify the top 3 to 4 factors that lead to clients leaving.

 - Gather and analyze statistical information on both groups (e.g., find averages, means).
Determine the leading factors that contribute to client loss, based on your analysis of the data provided.

 - Document your results and how you reached them.

- Using the information I uncover, create a decision tree to determine the probability of customers leaving the bank.
